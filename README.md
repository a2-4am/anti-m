Boot any Apple II disk on any Apple II

[Download latest Anti-M disk image](https://github.com/a2-4am/anti-m/releases/download/v1.7/anti-m-v1.7-2020-08-11.dsk)
(version **1.7**, released **2020-08-11**, runs on any 48K Apple II)

## What is this?

Many early Apple II games only worked on the original Apple II or Apple ][+.
They refuse to boot on later models, often displaying an "M" error code. This
was due to overly aggressive copy protection; late in the boot process, there
is code that checksums the ROM and reboots if it's not recognized. The games
themselves would work fine if they were allowed to boot past this ROM check.

Other games fail on an enhanced Apple //e, due to subtle differences between
6502 and 65c02 processors. Still others fail on an Apple //c or IIgs, due to
changes in the boot PROM code. ProDOS fails to boot on clones like Franklin and
Pravetz. Then there are some _very_ early games that require a 13-sector drive.

Anti-M uses a modified boot PROM that can boot any disk, then controls the
game's bootloader long enough to bypass the ROM check and patch any 6502-
specific opcodes. The result: you can boot any Apple II disk on any Apple II.

## How do I use it?

Boot the Anti-M disk. When it prompts you to insert your original disk, do so,
then press `<RETURN>`. The game should boot normally.

(*) later re-released with different copy protection. Only the first release
requires Anti-M.

## Does Anti-M patch my original disk?

No! All patches are done in memory only. If you reboot your original disk
(without running Anti-M), it will fail as usual, because the ROM check or other
incompatible code is still there.

## Can I use Anti-M from a hard drive?

Yes! Copy the `ANTI.M.SYSTEM` file to anywhere on your ProDOS hard drive and
run it with your favorite launcher. Bonus feature: when launching Anti-M from
a hard drive, it will skip the prompt and immediately boot slot 6, drive 1.

## But wait, there's more!

Anti-M can also boot many games from drive 2, including all the games listed
above. If you launch Anti-M from slot 6 and it detects a disk in drive 2, it
will skip the prompt and immediately boot from drive 2. Otherwise, you can
press `2` at the prompt to boot from drive 2 instead of drive 1.

To disable auto-boot and show the prompt, even if Anti-M would normally skip
it, you can press either joystick button (open-apple or closed-apple key) while
launching Anti-M.
